# WordFrequencyMap

### This program counts unique words in txt files and outputs the results sorted alphabetically and by number of occurances

Place any txt files you would like to analyze in the WordFrequencyMap directory. If an output file is created, it will be placed in the same directory (output.filename)

Text files cannot have a BOM- if you need to remove it, I reccomend notepad++

## Sample run:

```
Enter input document name:      test.txt

Display results in console? Please enter yes or no.
yes


There are 4 unique words.

Alphabetical order:

bannana appears 1 times
more appears 1 times
once appears 1 times
test appears 3 times



In order from most common to least common:

3 test
1 bannana
1 more
1 once

Save results to txt file? Please enter yes or no.
yes
Writing results to output.test.txt

Run again? Please enter yes or no.
no
Press any key to continue . . .
